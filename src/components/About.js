                        <p>Originally from rural Illinois, I enlisted in the Army in order to afford to go to college. While in community college and at the University of Illinois, I began to pursue a career in education. In a GenEd class, I was introduced to coding for the first time. I found myself very interested in writing Python, but I continued to study History and French. After graduating, I spent some time assistant teaching in Rib√©rac, France. After being accepted into a master's program, I decided that, perhaps, education was not the correct path for me, so I pivoted and took a full stack web development bootcamp from Northwestern University's Professional School.</p>
