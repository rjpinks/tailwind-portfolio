# Tailwinds Portfolio

## Description

A clean, single-page React app that displays information about me in the hopes of getting a job. 

## Installation

Just simply install the dependencies in the package.json via npm i.

## Usage

Scroll through the page or click the buttons on the nav bar to smoothly scroll to the appropriate part of the page. The skills elements will enlarge on hover. The work experience will provide buttons to go to the code or see a display on hover. The social tabs on the left-hand side will expand on hover.

## Credits

Shout out to Code Commerce on youtube. I modeled my portfolio after his, and he taught me some valuable Tailwinds information.
